			<h1 id="aboutMeT">Hi! I'm <span id="special">Addy.</span></h1>

			<p class ="aboutMeP">I am currently a senior at Centennial High School and have enjoyed my last two years by becoming more involved within the coding community. I was first introduced to the world of computer science during middle school when I took an engineering course. Although, I have always been interested in technology whether it be in playing video games or on the functionality of certain applications. Nowadays I am experienced in coding languages such as Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.<br><br>

			There are many stigmas within computer science, such as computer scientists often working alone and adopting antisocial habits. As I spent time in Student Leadership John's Creek and coding classes, I realized how important being a leader as well as being a part of a team in computer science is. My leadership philosophy focuses on encouraging and cultivating the ideas of others. The things I value most are kindness and respect while working in a team. <br><br>

			Other than my interest in coding, I love taking care of plants and finding new music to listen to. I visit plant nurseries way too frequently and am waiting for my next opportunity to go to a concert!</p>

		<h1 id="workPortT">Work Portfolio.</h1>

		<p class="bgInfoP"><span id="h">Model UN</span></p>

		<p class="bgInfoP">As Director of Mentorship of Model UN I have hosted many meetings throughout the year in order to help new members of the club. I also took part in directing Centennial High School's open conference that had around 40 participants. Before the conference, I hosted meetings to help prepare the participants. During the conference, I was mainly in charge of technology and the overall flow of the day.</p>

		<p class="bgInfoP"><span id="h">Beta Club</span></p>

		<p class="bgInfoP">As President of Beta Club I have hosted a meeting every month for the club to share events and other important information. This year I hosted a toiletry drive through North Fulton Charities and collected over 250 toiletries. In 2019, I helped the president of the club host a coat drive where over 200 coats were collected.</p>

		<p class="bgInfoP"><span id="h">Sustainable Development Goals Club</span></p>

		<p class="bgInfoP">When I worked as an Events Coordinator for Sustainable Development Goals Club I was in a team of three where we would collaborate with one another regularly. We shared many events within the club, but often faced difficulties because of the pandemic. My favorite thing I did in the club was host online meetings about sustainable development goals. I also made any meeting I was not hosting to participate in any discussions.</p>

		<p class="bgInfoP"><span id="h">Unity in Community</span></p>

		<p class="bgInfoP">Unity in Community was an organization I co-founded for a project a part of Student Leadership John's Creek. It was a massive learning experience for me and my team as we had to start a volunteer organization during the pandemic. I was in charge of communicating with a senior center in order to host events. At times, I was emailing them daily in order to work through certain technological difficulties and other problems. We were able to host a gift drive for the seniors as well as host zoom calls to interact with them.</p>

		<p class="bgInfoP"><span id="h">Cross Country</span></p>

		<p class="bgInfoP">I have sacrificed a lot of time to be a part of Cross Country, but I have enjoyed a lot of it. I would have practice everyday as well as a meet almost every weekend. During my time, I was able to gain a Varsity Letter as well as Scholar Athlete Awards. I ran over 100 miles during the summer and joined the 100 mile club in my team which was a big goal I had set for myself as well.</p>
